## Project Overview

This project is a web application developed using ASP.NET Core (C#). Users can enter texts containing emotional expressions into the application, and emotion analysis is performed using artificial intelligence (Hugging Face API) and a custom filtering algorithm.

## Key Features

- Text-based emotion analysis using Hugging Face API
- Custom filtering algorithm for improved accuracy
- Music recommendations based on emotional analysis
- MongoDB database integration for music data storage
- User-friendly interface for seamless interaction

## Technical Implementation

The application uses ASP.NET Core for the backend, with C# as the primary programming language. The emotion analysis is performed using the Hugging Face API, which provides powerful natural language processing capabilities. The results are then filtered using a custom algorithm to improve accuracy.

The music data is stored in a MongoDB database, which allows for flexible and scalable data storage. The application retrieves music recommendations based on the emotional analysis results and presents them to the user in an intuitive interface.
