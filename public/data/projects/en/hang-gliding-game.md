## Project Overview

A 3D game prototype developed with Unity for people undergoing physical therapy. The game aims to help patients with their therapy by having them navigate through obstacles and pass through rings in a limited area using only direction keys.

## Key Features

- 3D hang gliding gameplay
- Obstacle avoidance challenges
- Ring passing objectives
- Simple controls using only direction keys
- Designed for physical therapy patients

## Technical Implementation

The game is developed using Unity, with a focus on creating a simple yet engaging experience that can be played by people undergoing physical therapy. The controls are limited to direction keys, making it accessible for patients with limited mobility.

The game features a 3D hang gliding experience, where players navigate through a limited area, avoiding obstacles and passing through rings. The challenges are designed to be engaging while also providing therapeutic benefits, helping patients with their recovery.
