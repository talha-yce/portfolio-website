## Project Overview

A snowboard racing game prototype developed with Unity using spline for people undergoing physical therapy. The game aims to help patients with their therapy by having them race on a spline-created track, avoiding obstacles and trying to reach the finish line first against bots using only direction keys.

## Key Features

- Snowboard racing gameplay
- Spline-created race tracks
- Obstacle avoidance challenges
- Racing against AI opponents
- Simple controls using only direction keys
- Designed for physical therapy patients

## Technical Implementation

The game is developed using Unity with spline technology, allowing for the creation of smooth and dynamic race tracks. The controls are limited to direction keys, making it accessible for patients with limited mobility.

The game features a snowboard racing experience, where players race against AI opponents on spline-created tracks, avoiding obstacles and trying to reach the finish line first. The challenges are designed to be engaging while also providing therapeutic benefits, helping patients with their recovery.
